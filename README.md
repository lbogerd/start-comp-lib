# HEAVY WORK IN PROGRESS

This is a project to build your own library of components and share them with others similar to shadcn/ui.

The following features are planned:

- [ ] A simple way to preview your components, similar to Storybook but lighter and easier to use. Includes a automatically generated preview as well as simple controls to test the component.
- [x] Sharing components via copy/paste.
- [ ] Sharing components via shadcn CLI by dynamically building a ['registry' of components](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry).
- [ ] Sharing components as a NPM package using ['tsdown' to build the package](https://github.com/rolldown/tsdown).
- [ ] Extend above functionality to include other registry items like hooks, pages, and more.
